          I'm Tobia, a passionate 3D enthusiast with a solid background in CGI.
          Based in Italy, I've recently embarked on an exciting journey into the
          world of web development. Through this site, you can join me as I
          navigate this new terrain and document my progress. As a former CGI
          artist, I've honed my skills in crafting immersive digital
          experiences, and now, as a junior web developer, I'm eager to
          translate that creativity into the realm of web design and
          development. My fascination with shapes, textures, and storytelling
          fuels my quest to master the art of coding and design in the digital
          landscape. When I'm not coding or experimenting with new technologies,
          you can find me exploring the outdoors or indulging in my love for
          gaming. From hiking trails to virtual worlds, I find inspiration in
          every corner of life. Thanks for stopping by my portfolio! Let's
          embark on this journey together as we explore the endless
          possibilities of web development and design.
