          <h1>Hey there!</h1>
          <p class="mx-2">
            I'm Tobia, a passionate 3D enthusiast with a solid background in
            CGI. Based in Italy, I’ve transitioned into the world of web
            development and IT, where I now work full-time in the luxury fashion
            industry. Over the past year, I’ve been involved in developing and
            maintaining business-critical systems, including building a custom
            PHP-based integration between Lectra Kubix Link (PLM) and Microsoft
            NAV 365 (ERP). Through this site, you can follow my journey as I
            continue to evolve as a developer, combining creativity with
            technical problem-solving. My foundation in CGI taught me how to
            craft immersive visual experiences—skills I now bring into web
            development, whether designing engaging user interfaces or building
            smart backend logic. When I'm not coding, debugging, or diving into
            new technologies, you’ll find me outdoors, or exploring the
            intersection between art and tech. From 3D graphics to web systems,
            I’m driven by a deep curiosity and the desire to build things that
            work—and look—great. Thanks for stopping by my portfolio. Let’s
            explore the ever-evolving world of tech and design together!

          <h1>My Approach to Programming in the Age of AI</h1>
          <p class="mx-2">
            Entering the programming world in recent years means I’ve grown
            alongside the rise of AI. From the beginning, I’ve seen it not as a
            threat, but as a powerful tool—something to understand, experiment
            with, and integrate into my daily workflow. I don’t claim to master
            any specific language, though I have more experience with PHP,
            JavaScript, and Vue. My focus is on understanding logic, systems,
            and problem-solving over syntax. I believe language-specific skills
            will become increasingly fluid as tools evolve, and adaptability
            will matter more than memorization. That said, I don’t rely blindly
            on AI. I use it the same way seasoned developers use Stack Overflow
            or documentation: to learn faster, validate ideas, and avoid wasting
            time on what doesn’t need to be reinvented. Some say AI is ruining
            development. That’s like saying the typewriter ruined handwriting,
            or that Google destroyed learning because we stopped memorizing
            dates. Tools don’t make people lazy—people do. What matters is how
            you use them. I believe that knowing how to use AI effectively is a
            skill like any other—it takes time, practice, and critical thinking.
            Those who rely on it blindly, or reject it completely, will both be
            left behind. The future belongs to those who can combine human
            insight with smart, evolving tools. My goal is to write clean,
            purposeful code and grow every day, combining reasoning with modern
            resources.
