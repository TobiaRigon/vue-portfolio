        <h1>Hey there!</h1>
        <p class="mx-2">
          I'm Tobia, a passionate 3D enthusiast with a solid background in CGI.
          Based in Italy, I’ve transitioned into the world of web development
          and IT, where I now work full-time in the luxury fashion industry.
          Over the past year, I’ve been involved in developing and maintaining
          business-critical systems, including building a custom PHP-based
          integration between Lectra Kubix Link (PLM) and Microsoft NAV 365
          (ERP). Through this site, you can follow my journey as I continue to
          evolve as a developer, combining creativity with technical
          problem-solving. My foundation in CGI taught me how to craft immersive
          visual experiences—skills I now bring into web development, whether
          designing engaging user interfaces or building smart backend logic.
          When I'm not coding, debugging, or diving into new technologies,
          you’ll find me outdoors, gaming, or exploring the intersection between
          art and tech. From 3D graphics to web systems, I’m driven by a deep
          curiosity and the desire to build things that work—and look—great.
          Thanks for stopping by my portfolio. Let’s explore the ever-evolving
          world of tech and design together!
